    <p>This photo is a poster for a brass band convention that my church hosted in 2023. Me and my older sister were both in this convention, I played the French Horn while my sister played the Flute. Pathway Brass Band (also known as Pathway Music Ministries) also has their own YouTube channel, which I've linked below if you want to check it out.</p>

    <h2>Other Music Preferences</h2>
    <p>I also enjoy listening to classical music as whole. I've put some videos of some classical performers that I personally enjoy quite a bit, check them out if you're interested!</p>
