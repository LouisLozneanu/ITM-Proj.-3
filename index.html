    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>School</h2>
      <p>My name is Louis Lozneanu and I am a 2nd year student at IIT. My major is in Applied Analytics and I am getting my minor in Artificial Intelligence. I do not live too far away from school so I usually commute across the exrepssway in order to attend my classes each semester. I have 2 older sisters, one of which is working and the other is wrapping up her Master's Degree. I love to spend time with the both of them!</p>

      <h2>Beliefs/Church</h2>
      <p>My belief and faith in Jesus Christ as the One true God and the only way into Heaven is what matters most to me and my indentity. I believe that the Bible is the Word of God. I am a member of Bethany Romanian Pentecostal Church and I serve there in many ways, including their brass band and orchestra (more about this in the music tab).</p>

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>Some of my hobbies include playing music, but that is talked about more in my "Music" tab. I also enjoy many video games, especially Nintendo games. I've grown up playing certain franchises like The Legend of Zelda and Fire Emblem.</p>

      <p>I've also recently gotten back into reading books. One book that I've been reading a lot recently is Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis. In this book, Lewis goes over and explains the Christian faith in a very simple and logical way. Another really cool thing about this book is that it was originally done as a talk show during World War II and was later written down as a book.</p>
